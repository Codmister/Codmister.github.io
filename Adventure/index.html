<h1 style="color:red; font-family:courier;text-align:center;"> A visit to Persepolis </h1>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:courier"> September 1, 2015 </h2>
<p style="font-family:courier:"> We went to Persepolis today and it was a cool place to be at. Iran is nothing like how the web tells it to be. By the internets understanding I would have been shot and or kidknapped, but neither of those things have happened yet which is great. Also the people are nice I am just happy I brang my Farsi phrasebook otherwise I think I would not have understood some of them. </p>

<h1 style="color:red;font-family:courier;text-align:center;"> A visit to the Babak Castle </h1>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:courier"> September 5, 2015 </h2> 
<p style="font-family:courier:"> I learned alot about the Babak Castle like,  It was the stronghold of Babak Khorramdin, the leader of the Khurramites in Iranian Azerbaijan who fought the Islamic caliphate of Abbassids. After all that we ran into a farsi (farsi means theif) who stole some of our jewlery.  </p>

<h1 style="color:red;font-family:courier;text-align:center;"> Drive down Chalus Road </h1>
<h2 style="color:blue;font-family:courier"> September 14, 2015 </h2> 
<p style="font-family:courier:">  We went down Chalus Road and that is the main source of transportation that we used to get places. Chalus Road took us many places but at the same time it felt like its own place because of where it took us and how cool it looked in itself.  </p>
